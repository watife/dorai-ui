#### Single or Multiple

By default, multiple accordion groups can be open at the same time, we can control this by changing the type props to single as shown below;

```jsx
import { Accordion } from '@dorai-ui/accordion'

const AccordionComp = () => (
  <Accordion type='single'>
    <Accordion.Group>
      <Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Trigger />
      </Accordion.Header>
      <Accordion.Panel />
    </Accordion.Group>
  </Accordion>
)
```

#### Open render prop

Also, the open state of each accordion group is exposed through the render prop as shown below;

```jsx
import { Accordion } from '@dorai-ui/accordion'

const AccordionComp = () => (
  <Accordion>
    <Accordion.Group>
      {({ open }) => (
        <>
          <Accordion.Header>
            <Accordion.Trigger />
          </Accordion.Header>
          <Accordion.Panel />
        </>
      )}
    </Accordion.Group>
  </Accordion>
)
```
