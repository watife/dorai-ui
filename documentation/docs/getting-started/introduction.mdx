## Core Features

Dorai thrives in its core features;

### üé® &nbsp; Unstyled and Highly Customizable

Since Dorai components are fully unstyled, it gets rid of the frustration that comes with extending a component library styles.
Do you want to use utility styles or CSS-in-JS? Styles rest in your absolute control.

### üöÄ &nbsp; Accessible

Most component accessiblity requirement have been standardized by [WAI_ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/#aria_ex). Supporting accessiblity might be a difficult task for every design implementation developers have to build. Dorai offers components that are accessible at their core. We can say, your team will need to do nothing in terms of making these components accessible.

### ‚öìÔ∏è &nbsp; Controlled and UnControlled Components

Dorai components are controlled offering much functionalities out of the box but also grants you the ability to control the functionality of these components as deemed fit. Efforts are been made to make as much component uncontrolled as possible.

### üè† &nbsp; Composed Components

Dorai components are building blocks and not tightly coupled. No endless control / position props, hence no new learning curve with each component.

### üéÅ &nbsp; Independent & All-in-One

Dorai components are independently shipped. This grants the ability to install a single component or multiple as needed. All of the components can be added by installing the @dorai-ui/components.

## Installation

Dorai components can be installed individually or all at once by installing `@dorai-ui/components` using the command below;

```sh
npm i @dorai-ui/components
```

or

```sh
yarn add @dorai-ui/components
```

### Incremental Adoption

All components exists individually, you can install each by checking the components list in the docs sidebar.

For example, to install just the switch component, we can run the command below;

```
yarn add @dorai-ui/switch
```

or

```
npm i @dorai-ui/switch
```
