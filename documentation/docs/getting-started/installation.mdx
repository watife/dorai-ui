# Installation

> Dorai components can be installed individually or all at once by installing `@dorai-ui/components` using the command below;

```sh
npm i @dorai-ui/components
```

OR

```sh
yarn add @dorai-ui/components
```

## Incremental Adoption

All components exists individually, you can install each by checking the components list in the docs sidebar.

For example, to install just the switch component, we can run the command below;

```
yarn add @dorai-ui/switch
```

or

```
npm i @dorai-ui/switch
```
