# Accessiblity

> Dorai components are accessible handling difficult accessiblity requirements such as focuslock for modals automatically following [WAI_ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/#aria_ex) specification.

## Focus Management

Working with accessible components means that focus has to be managed automatically or anticipated in some cases. <br />
For example, with the alert-dialog component, focus is automatically moved to the cancel button anticipating user prevered action. <br />
Also, focus is locked within a modal hence tabbing would only move within it's focusable components.

## Aria Specification

The Aria specification by [WAI_ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/#aria_ex) is strictly adhered to in Dorai hence roles and aria-\*
are automatically handled.

## Keyboard Navigation

As specified by WAI_ARIA, components such as Tabs, Modal, comes with keyboard navigation expectations which dorai components adheres to.
