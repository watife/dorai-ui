# DoraiUI NextJS app starter with TailwindCSS and Typescript

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Integrated into this example is the Tailwind CSS library and DoraiUI unstyled accessible component library. This example supports TypeScript and JavaScript, as well as the App Router (`app/`) and the pages directory `pages/`.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello) is an endpoint that uses [Route Handlers](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/routing/route-handlers). This endpoint can be edited in `app/api/hello/route.ts`.
